# aws-ops-automation

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of automation scripts and tools developed during my work as a **Cloud Engineer at AWS**. The focus of this project is to solve recurring operational and infrastructure-related problems by applying software engineering principles to real-world AWS environments.

Rather than one-off scripts, the code in this repository is written with **reusability, safety, and clarity** in mind, reflecting production-facing scenarios commonly encountered when operating cloud infrastructure at scale.

---

## Goals of This Repository

- Automate repetitive AWS operational tasks
- Reduce manual intervention and human error
- Demonstrate practical cloud engineering and software development skills
- Apply clean code practices to infrastructure automation
- Serve as a growing toolkit for AWS operations and cloud workflows

---

## What You'll Find Here

The scripts in this repository typically address areas such as:

- AWS resource inspection and reporting
- Operational troubleshooting and diagnostics
- Environment hygiene and cleanup tasks
- Workflow automation across AWS services
- CLI-based tooling to simplify common cloud operations

Each script is designed to be:
- **Focused** on a specific operational problem
- **Safe to run** with clear output and guardrails where applicable
- **Easy to extend** for similar use cases

---

## Technologies & Tools

Depending on the script, you may see usage of:

- AWS CLI
- AWS SDKs (e.g., boto3)
- Python
- Bash / Shell scripting
- JSON / YAML for configuration and output

The tooling is intentionally lightweight and aligned with what is commonly available in real AWS environments.

---

## Repository Structure

Scripts are organized by functionality and use case. Each script includes:

- A clear description of the problem it solves
- Required permissions and prerequisites
- Usage instructions and example output (where applicable)

As the repository grows, additional structure and shared utilities may be introduced.

---

## Engineering Principles

This repository reflects the following principles:

- **Automation-first mindset** — prefer repeatable code over manual steps
- **Clarity over cleverness** — readable and maintainable scripts
- **Fail-safe behavior** — avoid destructive actions unless explicitly intended
- **Real-world applicability** — scripts are based on actual operational needs

---

## Disclaimer

The scripts in this repository are provided for **educational and demonstration purposes**. They are based on general AWS usage patterns and do not contain proprietary information. Always review and test scripts in a safe environment before using them in production.

## About Me

I am a Cloud Engineer with hands-on experience supporting and operating AWS infrastructure, currently writing code to automate regularly faced problems. This repository serves as a practical demonstration of my ability to bridge cloud operations and software engineering.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements may include:

- Converting scripts into reusable CLI tools
- Improved error handling and logging
- Shared utility modules
- Expanded documentation and examples
